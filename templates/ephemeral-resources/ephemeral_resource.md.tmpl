## Example Usage

{{- range .ExampleFiles }}

{{ tffile . }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImportIdentityConfig }}

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [` + "`" + `import` + "`" + ` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the ` + "`" + `identity` + "`" + ` attribute, for example:

{{tffile .ImportIdentityConfigFile }}

{{ .IdentitySchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImportIDConfig }}

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [` + "`" + `import` + "`" + ` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the ` + "`" + `id` + "`" + ` attribute, for example:

{{tffile .ImportIDConfigFile }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImport }}

The [` + "`" + `terraform import` + "`" + ` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

{{codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}
{{- end }}

## OpenAPI Specification

HTTP API contract for Terraform `denobridge_ephemeral_resource` implementations.

This specification defines the endpoints that a Deno TypeScript script must implement
to provide ephemeral resource functionality in Terraform.

Ephemeral resources are short-lived resources that exist only during a Terraform
operation (plan/apply). They are typically used for temporary credentials, tokens,
or other time-sensitive data. The provider will start your Deno script as an HTTP
server and manage the ephemeral resource lifecycle through these endpoints.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0

  title: DenoBridge Ephemeral Resource API
  version: 1.0.0

        The provider polls this endpoint until it receives a successful response
        before attempting to call any other lifecycle endpoints.
      responses:
        "204":

  /renew:
    post:
      summary: Renew the ephemeral resource (optional)
      description: |
        Optional endpoint to renew an ephemeral resource that may expire.

        This is called at the time specified by the renewAt value returned
        from /open or a previous /renew call. If this endpoint is not
        implemented (returns 404), the provider will not attempt to renew.

        The request body contains the private data returned from /open or
        the previous /renew call.

        Optional endpoint to clean up an ephemeral resource when it's no longer needed.

        This is called when the Terraform operation completes or when the resource
        is no longer referenced. If this endpoint is not implemented (returns 404),
        the provider will not attempt cleanup.

        The request body contains the private data returned from /open or
        the most recent /renew call.

## Example Server

This shows how one might fulfil the above OpenAPI specification.

The script **MUST** export a `default` export that satisfies `Deno.ServeDefaultExport`.
So that it can be executed with [`deno serve`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/serve/).

_NB: Using Hono is not a requirement, your welcome to use your favorite HTTP server library._

```ts
import { Hono } from "jsr:@hono/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/health", (c) => {
  return c.body(null, 204);
});

app.post("/open", async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { type } = body.props;

  if (type !== "v4") {
    return c.json({ error: "Unsupported UUID type" }, 422);
  }

  return c.json(crypto.randomUUID());
});

export default app satisfies Deno.ServeDefaultExport;
```

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

{{ if .HasExamples -}}
## Example Usage

{{- range .ExampleFiles }}

{{ tffile . }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
{{- if or .HasImport .HasImportIDConfig .HasImportIdentityConfig }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImportIdentityConfig }}

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [` + "`" + `import` + "`" + ` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the ` + "`" + `identity` + "`" + ` attribute, for example:

{{tffile .ImportIdentityConfigFile }}

{{ .IdentitySchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImportIDConfig }}

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [` + "`" + `import` + "`" + ` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the ` + "`" + `id` + "`" + ` attribute, for example:

{{tffile .ImportIDConfigFile }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImport }}

The [` + "`" + `terraform import` + "`" + ` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

{{codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}
{{- end }}

## OpenAPI Specification

HTTP API contract for Terraform `denobridge_resource` implementations.

This specification defines the endpoints that a Deno TypeScript script must implement
to provide full CRUD lifecycle support for a Terraform managed resource.

The provider will start your Deno script as an HTTP server and make requests to
these endpoints to manage the resource lifecycle.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: DenoBridge Resource API
  version: 1.0.0

servers:
  - url: http://localhost:{port}
    description: Local Deno HTTP server (port assigned dynamically)

paths:
  /health:

      summary: Health check endpoint
      description: |
        The provider polls this endpoint until it receives a successful response
        before attempting to call any other lifecycle endpoints.

      summary: Read the current state of an existing resource
      description: |
        Refreshes the current state of a resource. Should return updated props
        and state that may have changed since creation or last update.

        If the resource no longer exists, return `{"exists": false}` to signal
        Terraform to remove it from state (triggering re-creation on next plan).

                    Current properties of the resource from Terraform state.
                    As much as possible you should only rely on the id to be able
                    to lookup the current props & state.

                    But in some cases you may need more than the id to uniquely identify a resource,
                    in which case you can use the previously saved props but keep in mind these may
                    not always be available.

                    You should highlight these additional props that are required for identification in your resource docs.
                    This is especially important when importing existing resources.

## Example Server

This shows how one might fulfil the above OpenAPI specification.

The script **MUST** export a `default` export that satisfies `Deno.ServeDefaultExport`.
So that it can be executed with [`deno serve`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/serve/).

_NB: Using Hono is not a requirement, your welcome to use your favorite HTTP server library._

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/health", (c) => {
  // The provider will poll this endpoint until it gets a good response before
  // attempting to call any of the other lifecycle endpoints
  return c.body(null, 204);
});

app.post("/create", async (c) => {
  // Create is given a set of props that should contain all required
  // information to create a new instance of the resource.
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { path, content } = body.props;

  // In this case we are just creating a file
  await Deno.writeTextFile(path, content);

  return c.json({
    // At minimum, the create endpoint must return an id that uniquely identifies this resource.
    id: path,

    // Optional additional state that is only known after the resource is created can be returned in the state object.
    state: {
      mtime: (await Deno.stat(path)).mtime!.getTime(),
    },
  });
});

app.post("/read", async (c) => {
  // Read is given the id of a previously created resource along with it's props.
  // In this case the id is the same as the file path so we don't really need the
  // props to update the current state.
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { id } = body;
  // const { path } = body.props; id === path

  // The read methods job is to get the current state of an existing resource.
  // And return an updated set of props & optional additional state that may
  // have changed (by outside actors), since the resource was initially created
  // (or last updated).
  try {
    const content = await Deno.readTextFile(id);
    return c.json({
      props: { path: id, content },
      state: {
        mtime: (await Deno.stat(id)).mtime!.getTime(),
      },
    });
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof Deno.errors.NotFound) {
      // In the event we can no longer locate the resource we should signal
      // to tf to remove the resource from state. This will cause tf to re-create
      // the resource on the next plan.
      return c.json({ exists: false });
    }
    throw e;
  }
});

app.post("/update", async (c) => {
  // Update is given the id of a previously created resource along with the
  // current props & state (this will either have come from the saved tf state
  // or more likely be the refreshed data returned from the /read endpoint),
  // as well as the next set of props to update the resource to.
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { id } = body;
  const { path: currentPath } = body.currentProps;
  const { mtime: currentMTime } = body.currentState;
  const { path: nextPath, content: nextContent } = body.nextProps;

  // In this case an in place update is not supported for a file when the path
  // changes because that would mean the ID would change too & tf can't deal with that easily.
  // So we return an error here but if an update wouldn't result in a new ID, there is no need to return such an error.
  // Or implement the /modify-plan endpoint, which should have caught this & told tf to do a replacement instead (ie: create then delete).
  if (nextPath !== currentPath) {
    return c.json({ error: "Cannot change file path - requires resource replacement" }, 422);
  }

  // Perform the update
  await Deno.writeTextFile(currentPath, nextContent);

  // Return the updated state
  return c.json({ state: { mtime: (await Deno.stat(currentPath)).mtime!.getTime() } });

  // NB: If the update doesn't result in any state change (ie: there is simply no additional computed props to return)
  // Then you can return a 204 Not Content response to signal the update was successfully applied.
  // eg: return c.body(null, 204);
});

app.post("/delete", async (c) => {
  // Delete is given the id of a previously created resource along with it's props & any additional computed state.
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { id } = body;
  const { path } = body.props;
  const { mtime } = body.state;

  // Perform the delete
  await Deno.remove(path);

  // And signal success a 204 Not Content response.
  return c.body(null, 204);
});

// This endpoint is optional, if your server returns a 404, the provider will just carry on without making any plan modifications.
app.post("/modify-plan", async (c) => {
  // The ModifyPlan method is given:
  //  - The id of the resource (which could be empty if the resource is yet to be created)
  //  - The type of plan that we are modifying (create, update or delete)
  //  - nextProps will be set for create & update
  //  - currentProps will be set for update & delete
  //  - currentState will be set for update & delete
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { planType } = body;

  // If you decide you don't want to make any changes to the plan, just return a 204 No Content response.
  if (planType !== "update") {
    return c.body(null, 204);
  }

  // The most common use case for this endpoint is to tell tf if the resource
  // requires replacement (ie: create then delete) instead of an inline update.
  const { currentProps, nextProps } = body;
  return c.json({ requiresReplacement: currentProps.path !== nextProps.path });

  // Other use cases include returning a set of modifiedProps.
  // For example to provide default values for any unset props.
  // eg: return c.json({ modifiedProps: { content: nextProps?.content ?? "Hello World" } })

  // Or returning diagnostics, eg: for Destroy plans. As well as any other validation.
  // see: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification#resource-destroy-plan-diagnostics
  // eg: return c.json({
  //   diagnostics: [{
  //     severity: "warning",
  //     summary: "Resource Destruction Considerations",
  //     detail: `Applying this resource destruction will only remove the resource
  //             from the Terraform state and will not call the deletion API due to API limitations.
  //             Manually use the web interface to fully destroy this resource.`
  //   }]
  // })
});

export default app satisfies Deno.ServeDefaultExport;
